# Simple Transformer

A small version of the Transformer model ([Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).

## Features
- Single character token dictionary (size: 1*104) instead of huge word token dictionary.
- Embedding dimension: 1*252
- Based on [gptandchill.ai/codingproblems](https://www.gptandchill.ai/codingproblems) but with improved understandability
- Prompt: "I a"
- Output length: 500 characters
